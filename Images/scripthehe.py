# (2) Variables must start with a lowercase letter (or _)
# (3) Use either (a) camel-case notation or (b) underscore notation
# (4) Do not give variables names of reserved keywords


# 3 - Comparison Operators
# <     Less than
# >     Greater than
# <=    Less than or equal
# >=    Greater than or equal
# ==    Equality comparison
# !=    Inequality comparison
# ||    OR comparison
# &&    AND comparison

# If and Else

"""
price = 100
budget = 100

# If the budget is less than the price
if price <= budget:
    print("Buy the product")

# Othewise...
else:
    print("Don't buy the product")
"""

# If, elif, else

"""

if subscriptionTier == "free":
    print("The price is", 0)

elif subscriptionTier == "basic":
    print("The price is", 10)

elif subscriptionTier == "standard":

elif subscriptionTier == "premium":
